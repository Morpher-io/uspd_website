## Mint & Burn USPD

This interface allows you to interact with the core functionality of the USPD stablecoin:

*   **Minting:** Convert your ETH into USPD. The system uses the current ETH/USD price (provided by a secure oracle) and finds available stabilizer collateral to ensure your minted USPD is overcollateralized according to the protocol rules (typically 110% or higher).
*   **Burning:** Redeem your USPD back into ETH. The system calculates the equivalent ETH value based on the current oracle price and returns the corresponding collateral from the backing positions.

All operations require a signed price attestation from the oracle system to ensure accurate and secure conversions.
