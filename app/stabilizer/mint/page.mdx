# Mint Stabilizer NFT

This page allows anyone to mint a new Stabilizer NFT. Each NFT grants its owner unique privileges within the USPD ecosystem, including the ability to participate in liquidations based on the NFT's specific ID.

## Understanding Liquidation Privileges

Each Stabilizer NFT has an ID. This ID determines the collateralization ratio threshold at which its owner can liquidate an undercollateralized user position.
Generally, NFTs with lower IDs can liquidate positions at higher collateralization ratios, offering a potential advantage. The specific threshold for the next NFT to be minted is displayed above the minting form.

## Process

1.  **Connect Wallet:** Ensure your wallet is connected and you are on the correct network where the `StabilizerNFT` contract is deployed.
2.  **Review Next NFT ID & Liquidation Info:** The page will display the Token ID of the next Stabilizer NFT that will be minted and the liquidation threshold associated with it.
3.  **Enter Recipient Address:** Provide the Ethereum address that will own the new NFT.
4.  **Mint:** Click the "Mint NFT" button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Upon successful minting, the specified recipient address will receive the new Stabilizer NFT. This NFT represents a new, independent stabilizer position. The owner can then proceed to add collateral to its associated `StabilizerEscrow` to begin earning rewards or use its liquidation privileges.
