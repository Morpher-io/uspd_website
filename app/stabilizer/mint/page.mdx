# Mint Stabilizer NFT

This page allows authorized administrators (accounts with the `MINTER_ROLE` on the `StabilizerNFT` contract) to mint new Stabilizer NFTs.

## Process

1.  **Connect Wallet:** Ensure your wallet is connected and you are on the correct network where the `StabilizerNFT` contract is deployed.
2.  **Permissions Check:** The application will automatically verify if your connected account holds the necessary `MINTER_ROLE`. If you do not have the role, you will be redirected back to the main Stabilizer page.
3.  **Enter Details:** Provide the Ethereum address that will own the new NFT (the Recipient Address) and a unique Token ID for the new NFT.
4.  **Mint:** Click the "Mint NFT" button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

Upon successful minting, the specified recipient address will receive the Stabilizer NFT with the chosen Token ID. This NFT represents a new, independent stabilizer position within the USPD system. The owner can then proceed to add collateral to its associated `StabilizerEscrow`.
