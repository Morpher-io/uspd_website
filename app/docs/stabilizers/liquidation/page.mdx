# Liquidation Process

The liquidation mechanism is a critical component that ensures the USPD system remains solvent and the 1:1 USD peg is maintained. It creates incentives for third-party actors (Liquidators) to intervene when a Stabilizer's position becomes undercollateralized.

## When Liquidation Occurs

A Stabilizer position becomes eligible for liquidation when its collateralization ratio falls below its specific liquidation threshold. This threshold is dynamic and depends on the Stabilizer's NFT ID:

-   **Stabilizer NFT #1:** Can be liquidated if the ratio drops below **125%**.
-   **Stabilizer NFT #2:** Can be liquidated if the ratio drops below **124.5%**.
-   **Stabilizer NFT #3:** Can be liquidated if the ratio drops below **124%**.
-   ...and so on, decreasing by 0.5% for each subsequent ID.

This can happen due to a decrease in the price of ETH, which reduces the value of the underlying stETH collateral relative to the fixed USPD debt.

## Liquidation Mechanics

    C --> D[Liquidator Receives Collateral at a Discount]
    D --> E[Liquidator Profits from the Discount]
    A --> F[System Solvency is Restored]
```

When a position is liquidated, a liquidator repays the outstanding USPD debt associated with that position. In return, they receive the position's underlying stETH collateral at a discount, which provides the financial incentive to perform the liquidation.

This process removes the risky position from the system and ensures that all outstanding USPD remains fully overcollateralized. For a detailed breakdown of the financial incentives and calculations, please see our economics documentation.

## Emergency Fund

A portion of the collateral from a liquidation event may be directed to a system-wide emergency fund. This fund serves as a secondary buffer to protect the system against extreme market events and ensure long-term stability.

## Best Practices for Stabilizers

1.  **Monitor Position Health:** Regularly check your position's collateralization ratio.
2.  **Maintain a Buffer:** Add collateral to keep your ratio comfortably above your specific liquidation threshold.
3.  **Understand Market Conditions:** Be aware of ETH price movements and their potential impact on your position.

## For Liquidators

-   Monitor the blockchain for undercollateralized positions that are eligible for liquidation.
-   Maintain a reserve of USPD to repay debt during a liquidation.
-   Analyze the potential profitability of a liquidation, considering the collateral discount and gas costs.
