# Stabilizer Dashboard

This dashboard provides an overview of your Stabilizer NFTs and allows you to manage your positions within the USPD system.

## Your Positions

Below you will find a card for each Stabilizer NFT you own. Each card displays:

*   **Unallocated Funds:** The amount of stETH currently held in the dedicated `StabilizerEscrow` for this NFT, ready to be allocated to back new USPD mints. You can add more ETH (which will be converted to stETH) or withdraw existing unallocated stETH.
*   **Allocated Position:** Details about the stETH currently backing USPD liability in the dedicated `PositionEscrow`.
    *   **Total Collateral:** The total stETH held (from users and your contribution).
    *   **Backed Liability:** The amount of cUSPD shares this position is currently backing.
    *   **Current Ratio:** The live collateralization ratio of this position, calculated using the current stETH balance and the oracle price.
    *   **Min Ratio (Set):** The minimum collateralization ratio you have configured for this position. The system uses this when allocating funds.
    *   You can add more collateral directly to the `PositionEscrow` (top-up) or withdraw excess collateral if the current ratio is above the minimum required (110%).

## Admin Actions

If your connected wallet has the `MINTER_ROLE` on the `StabilizerNFT` contract, an "Admin" card will appear, allowing you to navigate to the minting page to create new Stabilizer NFTs.
