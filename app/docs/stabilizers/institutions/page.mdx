# stUSPD: Institutional Staking Token

## Overview

stUSPD is a specialized token designed exclusively for institutional investors seeking fixed APY returns through Permissionless Technologies. Unlike the rebasing USPD token, stUSPD operates as a share-based token that accrues value over time, similar to cUSPD's architecture but completely detached from the broader USPD ecosystem.

## What is stUSPD?

stUSPD represents institutional investment shares that appreciate in value over time rather than rebasing. Each token acts as an IOU that becomes more valuable as yield accrues, providing institutions with:

- **Fixed APY Returns**: Predetermined annual percentage yields locked in at investment time
- **Share Appreciation**: Token value increases over time rather than token quantity
- **Institutional Compliance**: Built-in KYC requirements and regulatory compliance features
- **Regional Compliance**: Automatic escrow mechanisms for EU and US investors

## Target Audience

stUSPD is designed specifically for:

- **Institutional Investors**: Banks, hedge funds, pension funds, and other large financial institutions
- **Regulated Entities**: Organizations requiring compliance with KYC/AML regulations
- **High-Net-Worth Clients**: Minimum investment threshold of €100,000 equivalent
- **Long-term Investors**: Particularly suited for institutions comfortable with 1-year lock periods (EU/US)

## Key Features

### KYC-Gated Access
- All minting and burning operations require KYC verification
- Cryptographic signature validation from Permissionless Technologies
- Database-backed wallet verification system
- API-driven compliance checks

### Regional Compliance
- **EU Investors**: Automatic 1-year escrow period for regulatory compliance
- **US Investors**: Automatic 1-year escrow period for regulatory compliance
- **Other Regions**: Direct token receipt with standard transfer restrictions
- **Automated Release**: Tokens automatically released after lock period expires

### Minimum Investment Thresholds
- €100,000 minimum equivalent for all operations
- Real-time EUR/USD conversion via existing Redis infrastructure
- Dynamic threshold validation at transaction time

### Share-Based Appreciation
- Token value increases over time (similar to cUSPD model)
- No rebasing mechanics - share count remains constant
- Predictable value appreciation based on fixed APY terms
