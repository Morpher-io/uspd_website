# Adding Collateral to Stabilizers

Learn how to add collateral to your stabilizer position and manage it effectively to support the USPD system and avoid liquidation.

## Adding Initial Collateral

After minting a Stabilizer NFT, you must add ETH collateral to it. This collateral is held in your dedicated `StabilizerEscrow` and is used to overcollateralize USPD when users mint new tokens.

```solidity
// Add ETH collateral to your stabilizer's unallocated funds
function addUnallocatedFundsEth(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
    // The amount of ETH sent with the transaction becomes available collateral
}
```
For a detailed explanation of how this collateral is allocated, see the [USPD Architecture documentation](/docs/architecture).

## Managing Collateral Levels

### Checking Current Collateral

It is crucial to monitor your position's collateralization ratio. To be safe from liquidation by any other stabilizer, you must keep your ratio above **125%**. If your ratio falls below this level, the owner of Stabilizer NFT #1 can liquidate your position. If it falls further, other stabilizers with lower-priority NFTs can also initiate liquidation.

    A[Check Position] --> B{Collateral Ratio}
    B -->|Above 125%| C[Safe Zone]
    B -->|At or Below 125%| D[Danger Zone]
    C --> E[Can Withdraw Excess Collateral]
    D --> F[Risk of Liquidation]
```

### Withdrawing Excess Collateral

If the price of ETH increases, your position's collateralization ratio will rise. This may allow you to withdraw the excess stETH collateral while still maintaining a ratio safely above the 125% liquidation threshold.

1.  Calculate your current collateralization ratio.
2.  Determine the maximum amount of collateral you can withdraw.
3.  Execute the withdrawal transaction.

## Best Practices

1.  **Regular Monitoring**: Check your position's health frequently, especially during volatile market periods.
2.  **Buffer Maintenance**: Keep a healthy safety buffer above the 125% liquidation threshold to protect against sudden price drops.
3.  **Price Awareness**: Monitor ETH price movements and their impact on your collateral value.
4.  **Gas Optimization**: Consider gas fees when adding or withdrawing collateral to optimize costs.

## Safety Considerations

-   Never let your collateralization ratio approach the 125% threshold.
-   Maintain additional collateral in reserve to add quickly during market downturns.
-   Monitor gas prices for optimal transaction timing.
